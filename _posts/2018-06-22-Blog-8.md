    <td>To improve my learning, I thoroughly read through the instructions. This lead to me not failing many exercises because I wouldn't have known what to do otherwise. I found this technic very useful and was much better than just rushing through them and not knowing what to do. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>The exercises that I did get stuck on, I didn’t use a hint. This lead to me being stuck on one exercise for quite a long time. This was very time consuming and lead to me not doing as many exercises than I probably should have done.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time if i get really stuck, I will use a hint to get me through the exercise quicker. If I still can’t get the answer I will have to skip the exercise and read it back so I can improve and know what to do for next time.</td>
