    <td>I read over the instructions a couple of times before I started incase I missed a key detail the first time round. I did this so I didn't waste time trying to figure out what code to put in thinking that it was something else that wouldn’t get me anywhere. If I was stuck on an exercise, for a while, I would use a hint to help me.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Even after when I used a hint, and I still could not figure out what the answer was, I think I need to get the solution so then when it gives it to me, I will read over it so I know what to do for next time. The reason why I should do this in future is so I can learn what I did not already know and so that it doesn’t waste time.</td>
