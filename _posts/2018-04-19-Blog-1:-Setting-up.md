    <td>I used my knowledge from before to create a new repository and to add some colours to make it better. When I was using Codecademy at first it asked me some questions so I answered them so the code would suit me and not make it too hard or too easy. When I actually got onto the exercises I found the first two easy and I knew what I had to do but when I got onto exercises 3 and 4 I had know idea what it was talking about and wanted me to do.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>For the first two exercises I thought it was pretty self explanatory what it wanted me to do so I didn't bother to read the instructions on the left hand side of the screen. In the following questions I got stuck and I think that was the reason for it. So next time when I do this coding I now know that you have to read the instructions.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will read the instructions no matter how easy the question looks because it will probably help me in the coming exercises. I will also re-read over what I have written as I made a few mistakes so I donâ€™t waste time and so that I can get more of the exercises done.</td>
