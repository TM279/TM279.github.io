    <td>I found the tasks a lot easier when I read the examples. I also read the instructions of what to do. I also did a few questions in the second exercise so I could be more prepared for harder code.</td>

    <td>I need to read back my work because if I make a small mistake it will ruin my streak and I will have to then look back over all my code and see what was wrong. I will also need to read the hints at the bottom of the screen instead of wasting time trying to figure it out the hard way.</td>
