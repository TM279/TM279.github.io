    <td>I carefully read the instructions to make sure I understood what I had to do and if I got the question wrong the first time I would keep trying. After about the third or fourth time of getting it wrong I had to use a hint to help me so I didn't waste time and so that I could get through more exercises.</td>

    <td>When I really cannot get the answer and can’t figure out what it is, so I don’t waste time I think I just need to click on the solution button so then I can read the corrections so I will know for next time what to do. For some of the exercises they didn’t require anything because it was already there and I kept typing in code to try and figure out what the answer is when it was right in front of me from the start.</td>
